# Test-Me
An adaptable client-side web application for interactive learning. Easily load custom question sets from JSON files and filter practice sessions by subject, grade, or topic. Engage with diverse question types, including ordering and multi-select. Track progress with gamified stars and badges. Runs entirely in the browser.

Download the files from the Examples directory, then drag the files to the upload section of the live application (https://pestilence-and-war.github.io/test-me.github.io/) or inside of the live application, select the files from the downloads section after clicking the 'Browse Files' button.
